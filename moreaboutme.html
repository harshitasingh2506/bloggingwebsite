  <h2 class="blog-post-title">What is coding? A brief guide to the facet of computer programming</h2>
  <img src="./coder.jpeg" alt="">
  <p>Coding is the very backbone of the modern information age we live in. A facet of and often shorthand for computer programming, coding gets its name from the fact that computer programs are sets of instructions referred to as computer code. These terms are all interchangeable, so programmers are often referred to as coders.</p>

  <h3 class="blog-post-title">How coding works</h3>
  <img src="./howcodingworks.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Coding is a relatively technical field of study that typically requires a minimum of a four-year degree to effectively work as a programmer, though this isn't mandatory. Some coders are self-taught or start with a more modest two-year program and then learn on the job. But at its core, computer programming is a fairly straightforward task.</p>
